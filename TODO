 * Add support for adding instruments manually

 * Add support for test cases in lua scripts

   Add support for splitting a lua script into test cases for expressing
   pass/fail status via gui or console when running the script. This is a
   feature useful for test automation and reporting.

   The current idea is to define test cases via lua comments so that is becomes
   a layering not affecting normal script operation.

   Example lua test script:
 
    -- tc "Test case 1 description"
    
    print("This is test case 1")
    
    
    
    -- tc "Test case 2 description"
    
    print("This is test case 2")
    
    fail()
    
    
    
    -- tc "Test case 3 description"
    
    print("This is test case 3")
    
    fail_stop()
    
    
    
    -- tc "Test case 4 description"
    
    print("This is test case 4")
    
    

    -- tc end

    tc_save("test-results.log")
  

   When running the script the GUI will present a list of test cases and their
   pass/fail status as the script progresses. If run via command line tool lxi,
   a similar list will be presented in text.

   Also includes introduction of fail() function which will report failure and
   continue and fail_stop() function which will report failure and stop script
   execution.
